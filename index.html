            <h4 class="about-title">What is PLang Recommendation System?</h4>
            <p>
                PLang is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule-based_system" target="_blank">rule-based</a> expert system that is 
                developed and use to recommend the first programming language that user
                should learn. This expert system is developed with people who are interested in learning programming
                language, but don't know where to start, in mind. Our program uses simple, text-based console app to 
                gain user's input and display the result accordingly.
            </p>                            
        </div>
        <div class="w">
            <h4 class="about-title">Why did we develop it?</h4>
            <p>
                Choosing the first programming language is hard. Furthermore, picking the right one, the one that fits our need is much, much
                harder. Although the barrier to entry the programming world is fairly low - and also cheap, as much of resources and tools can be
                downloaded for free online - the overabundace of programming languages could overwhelm beginner and people who want to learn to code.
                This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice" target="_blank">Paradox of Choice</a>.                
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember the first time I decided dive into the programming world. I spent days and days looking for the best language to start 
                with, and well, it ended up with me switching back and forth between Python and Javascript. And that is not only a waste of time, as 
                indecision is worse than making a bad decision. And I think that a lot of people out there might share the same problem as mine.
            </p>
            <p>
                So by developing this expert system, we hope that we can help the newcomers, future computer science students, and aspiring developers
                to decide the best first programming language that they should learn, no matter as the tool that will help them secure a career in this 
                interesting field or as a stepping stone, enough to get their feet wet, for their journey as a developer, as programming is a <a href="https://medium.com/zerotomastery/learn-to-code-in-2019-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way-d4197f96be27" target="_blank">big, fun world</a>.

                    <h5 class="smaller-title">1. Knowledge Acquisition</h5>
                    <p>
                        Knowledge is essential for an expert system to work. And one of the most important step
                        when developing an expert system is the knowledge acquisition phase, where we extract knowledge from 
                        expert to transfer it into production rules. 
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        For knowledge acquisition, we used the power of the information on the internet to make our research.
                        We read numerous articles and blogs written by developers (who, we think are expert in their field and the respective
                        programming language that they use), analyze the job markets and Google trends to verify the article.                 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We list all the list of the resources that we use <a href="https://github.com/CharaeKeow/expertSystem" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <div class="sub-how">
                <h5 class="smaller-title">2. Design the Inference Engine</h5>
                <p>
                    After gather the knowledge and making the production rules, we design the core of our expert system
                    the Inference Engine. Basically, inference engine is inferring knowlege that is represented in rules
                    - i.e. production rules - and draw conclusion from those rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For our inference engine, we use forward chaining - i.e. we start with facts and use rules
                    to draw conclusion or take actions. We use forward chaining for our expert system
                    as we think its goal-driven approach is the most suitable for recommendation system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How forward chaining works is fairly simple. First, the program will analyze problem by looking for the facts 
                    that match the condition of the IF-THEN rules. Once it found the matching rules, it will select and execute the rules.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-how">
                <div class="text">
                    <h5 class="smaller-title">3. Code!</h5>
                    <p>
                        Now that we have all the data needed, and the production rules plus the inference engine, it's time to 
                        to do the coding. For developing the expert system, we use Python, rather than other conventional tools such as <a href="http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">CLIPS</a>.
                        This is mainly due to personal preference, as we think it is easier to do this expert system in Python. Besides, we don't want to spend too much
                        time on learning new syntax as we are fairly familiar with Python.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The coding process is rather simple, as the production rule is basically <code>if</code> statement. We use
                        <code>if</code> else if ( or <code>elif</code> in Python) plus <strong>nested <code>if</code></strong> to 
                        match and execute the production rules.

                    <h5 class="smaller-title">4. The UI</h5>
                    <p>
                        Our expert system is only a console-only app. Thus, it can be used via a text-only user
                        interface through the command line or terminal. Still, it is fully functional and can give 
                        the accurate result as desired.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the execution, the program will ask the user some question. Then, the user can select the 
                        option by typing the number of the option. Then, the inference engine will match, select, and execute
                        any matching rule behind the scene. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the conclusion is drawn, it will print the recommended programming language for the user plus a little
                        bit fun facts about the language.

            <h4 class="about-title">When to use this program?</h5>
            <p>
                Although this program is developed with anyone who want to pick his/her 
                programming language in mind, in can also be used by anyone who simply want to
                learn a new language. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it must be noted that this program might be biased toward certain programming
                language (as expert usually do). Also, the technological landscape is changing so fast that
                and may render this expert system's recommendation obselete some time in the future. Additionally,
                this expert system doesn't take all programming languages into our knowledge base, so we might
                overlook or oversimplify in some respects. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So, noted that you can always take the suggestion of this expert system, but also check the current
                trend and you can always decide which language is the right fit for you, as there might not be one size
                fits all for all problems.

                Developing this expert system is a new experience for us. Not only we have the chance
                what we have learned during our AI class, we also gain a lot of information while doing 
                the research. These experience will surely help latter in our course. As for the system itself,
                it is still far from other leading and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycin" target="_blank">well known</a> expert system. 
                But, we plan to improve this system by adding more knowledge and rules. The other thing on our radar is 
                making a better, perhaps web-based, UI for this expert system. The code is hosted on GitHub means
                that we can make any tweak anytime and this will also open the door for others to view and
                help to improve this system, too.
