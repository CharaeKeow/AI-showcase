# AI-showcase
showcase for our AI class project

## Programming Language Recommendation Tool
### Pssst, find a more catchier name please

We will develop an expert system that will recommend what programming language that the user
should learn. We use Javascript and probably CLIPS Tool for our project. I intended for it
to work on the web, as that is way much cooler than running on clips' bland interface, but
we will see to it later.
